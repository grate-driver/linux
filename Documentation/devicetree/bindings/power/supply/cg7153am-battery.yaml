title: Fuel gauge driver for Cypress CG7153AM based devices

maintainers:
  - Svyatoslav Ryhel <clamor95@gmail.com>

description: |
  The driver, apart from standard battery monitoring features,
  can utilize information from a simple-battery linked via a
  phandle in monitored-battery and gpio-charger. Additionally,
  driver can control power indication leds if correct flag is
  specified.

    description: |
      This property must be a phandle to a node using the format described
      in battery.yaml, with the following properties being required:
      - charge-full-design-microamp-hours: battery design capacity in microAh,
      - energy-full-design-microwatt-hours: battery design energy in microWh,
      - operating-range-celsius: operating temperature range of a battery.

  power-supplies:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/phandle-array
    description: |
      Specifies supplies used for charging the battery connected to this gauge.
