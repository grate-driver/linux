title: Drive a GPIO line that can be used to restart the system from a restart handler

description: |
  This binding supports level and edge triggered reset.  At driver load
  time, the driver will request the given gpio line and install a restart
  handler. If the optional properties 'open-source' is not found, the GPIO line
  will be driven in the inactive state.  Otherwise its not driven until
  the restart is initiated.

  When the system is restarted, the restart handler will be invoked in
  priority order.  The gpio is configured as an output, and driven active,
  triggering a level triggered reset condition. This will also cause an
  inactive->active edge condition, triggering positive edge triggered
  reset. After a delay specified by active-delay, the GPIO is set to
  inactive, thus causing an active->inactive edge, triggering negative edge
  triggered reset. After a delay specified by inactive-delay, the GPIO
  is driven active again.  After a delay specified by wait-delay, the
  restart handler completes allowing other restart handlers to be attempted.

      If the pin should be low to reset the board set it to "Active Low",
      otherwise set gpio to "Active High".

  open-source:
    description: |
      Treat the GPIO as being open source and defer driving
      it to when the restart is initiated.  If this optional property is not
      specified, the GPIO is initialized as an output in its inactive state.

    description: |
      A priority according to the following guidelines:
          0:  Restart handler of last resort, with limited restart capabilities
        128:  Default restart handler; use if no other restart handler is
              expected to be available, and/or if restart functionality is
              sufficient to restart the entire system
        255:  Highest priority restart handler, will preempt all other restart handlers
