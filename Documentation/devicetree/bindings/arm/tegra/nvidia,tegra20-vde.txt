NVIDIA Tegra Video Decoder Engine

Required properties:
- compatible : "nvidia,tegra20-vde"
- reg : Must contain 2 register ranges: registers and IRAM region that
        VDE uses for its internal needs and for passing some of decoding
        parameters.
- reg-names : Must include the following entries:
  - regs
  - iram
- interrupts : Must contain an entry for each entry in interrupt-names.
- interrupt-names : Must include the following entries:
  - ucq-error
  - sync-token
  - bsev
  - bsea
  - sxe
- clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names : Must include the following entries:
  - vde
- resets : Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names : Must include the following entries:
  - vde

Example:

vde@6001a000 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-vde";
	reg = <0x6001a000 0x3D00    /* VDE registers */
		0x40000400 0x3FC00>; /* IRAM region */
	reg-names = "regs", "iram";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI  8 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>, /* UCQ error interrupt */
			<GIC_SPI  9 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>, /* Sync token interrupt */
			<GIC_SPI 10 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>, /* BSE-V interrupt */
			<GIC_SPI 11 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>, /* BSE-A interrupt */
			<GIC_SPI 12 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>; /* SXE interrupt */
	interrupt-names = "ucq-error", "sync-token", "bsev", "bsea", "sxe";
	clocks = <&tegra_car TEGRA20_CLK_VDE>;
	clock-names = "vde";
	resets = <&tegra_car 61>;
	reset-names = "vde";
};
